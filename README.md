# DataAnalysis_Numpy_Assignment

### About the Assignment
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. You are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least ﬁve of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook. 
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. 
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least ﬁve “Distributions” functions. 
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### How to view the Assignment

The assignment can be viewed the following ways
1. Clicking on the "Numpy-random-assignment.ipynb" file above,
2. Downloading the Repo and running jupyter notebook in the command line.

### What is needed to run the Assignment

1. Anaconda Python as it contains all libraries
2. The Repo will need to be cloned or downloaded

### Assignment sections in the jupyter notebook
#### 1. Simple Randome Data
- rand(d0, d1, …, dn)
- numpy.random.randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
- numpy.random.randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype='l')
- numpy.random.sample(size=None)

#### 2. Permutations
- numpy.random.shuffle(x)
- numpy.random.permutation(x)

#### 3. Distributions
- numpy.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)¶
- numpy.random.uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
- numpy.random.binomial(n, p, size=None)
- numpy.random.triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
- numpy.random.negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)

#### 4. Numpy Seed
- numpy.random.seed(seed=None)
