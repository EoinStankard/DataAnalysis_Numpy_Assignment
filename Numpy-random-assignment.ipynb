    "The numpy.random package is a sub package of numpy. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four different sections to the numpy.random package\n",
    "1. Simple random Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple random data is used for the basic functions of the package such as generate a random integer between 1 and 10, or generate an array of 2 rows and 2 columns and fill it will random numbers between 0-1\n",
    "There are assumptions based on the numbers that are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section only contains two functions and they are both similar as they both shuffle or rearrange the number or numbers they are given\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributions section is the largest section of the four and they are all different probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "This section you can get the seed of the random number generator, get the state and set the state."
